# Ramine_Swift

This is using these functions:

 -camera
 -multi images, photolibrary
 -apple login
 -push notification
 
I just get that upgrade list
1) Check and clean what takes time to load/boot the app till app is ready to use
2) Camera
  a) image upload process - the app should not wait on uploading photos rather should show images and upload it in background / next screen
  b) when camera accessed from detailed screen add the click button and back button to return back
  c) add option to upload from gallery(in camera screen)
2) app should refresh the dashboard screen(reload table when upates are done)
3) store data locally as well as on server via api(currently everything is stored on server)
4) favorites to be loaded and saved to server too.
The app contain approach 15 screens
